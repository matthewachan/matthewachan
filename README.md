## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I work with [Prof. Christopher Metzler](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~metzler/) as part of the [Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://intelligent-sensing.github.io) on problems in computer vision / computational photography. 

Feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:mattchan@umd.edu) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewachan/).
